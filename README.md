# Deprecated
**Furrytail changed their HTTP API so this library doesn't work anymore at all.
I think there's a better idea: teardown your feeder and sniff UART communication between the ESP8266 and main MCU.
It would allow to design your own ESP8266 firmware and avoid Chinese cloud.
I don't have spare time for that.**

I'm too lazy to write any readme and the project is even WIP at this point. GoDoc should be enough for now.
